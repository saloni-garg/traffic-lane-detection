#Lane Detection System

Lane Detection System is a technology designed to reduce accidents on highways and relatively straight roads. 
Detects changes in lanes and accomodates required needs accordingly.
The technology detects and assigns a path as the center of the lane.
Triggers warning systems when it swerves away from the center and dangerously close to the edges of the lane.
